## 3d quantum wave engine

an interactive 3d simulator for quantum wave functions using React and Three.js. employs split-step fft for efficient time evolution of wave packets in various potentials.

### features
- gaussian wave packet injection with adjustable parameters
- presets: free space, plane barrier, box well, spherical well, harmonic oscillator
- real-time visualisation with phase colouring and orbital controls
- absorbing boundaries to mitigate fft artefacts
- adjustable grid size, time step, and rendering options

### usage
install dependencies with `npm install`, then run `npm run dev` to start the development server.



### why?

had an empty summer and no lectures. built a 2d one which was actually harder than the 3d one on my other repo if you want to check it out, or don't. i don't care.
